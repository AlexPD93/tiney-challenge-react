The challenge was to create a simple version of the tiney register app feature. I have chosen to complete this task in React. 

## Key user stories to consider: 
1. As a childcare provider, I’d like to see a list of children who attend my setting including their current register status (signed in or signed out).
2. As a childcare provider, I’d like to be able to sign in or sign out a child with a single tap from this screen.
3. As a childcare provider, I’d like to be able to see the log of register entries for a specific date.

## With more time:
1. I would have liked to have added the live time, date and day to the History component. So it would be possible to view when a specific cat has signed in in the past. 
2. I would also have liked to have saved the time and date of the cat sign in to local storage.
3. The button to switch between components would have styling to underline them when on the page.
