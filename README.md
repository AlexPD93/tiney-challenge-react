# tiney Take Home Challenge

The challenge was to create a simple version of the tiney register app feature. 

## Key user stories to consider: 
1. As a childcare provider, I’d like to see a list of children who attend my setting including their current register status (signed in or signed out)
2. As a childcare provider, I’d like to be able to sign in or sign out a child with a single tap from this screen
3. As a childcare provider, I’d like to be able to see the log of register entries for a specific date
